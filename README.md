## Java Inheritance Test: Home Appliances

Welcome to the Java Inheritance Test focusing on Home Appliances! This exercise is designed to assess your understanding of Java inheritance, specifically through the implementation of the `Appliance` and `Refrigerator` classes.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate and Edit**: Proceed to the `src/main/java/com/example` directory. Here, you'll find the Java class files for `Appliance` and `Refrigerator`.
3. **Implement Methods**: In each class file, implement the methods as directed by the TODO comments. Ensure that `Refrigerator` properly extends `Appliance`.
4. **Run Tests and Bonus Test**: After implementation, run the tests to verify your solutions. There's also a bonus test to challenge your understanding further.

### Classes to Implement

1. **Appliance.java (25 points)**
    - Represents a general home appliance, focusing on brand, model, and power usage attributes.
    - Implement methods for retrieving basic appliance information.

2. **Refrigerator.java (50 points)**
    - Extends `Appliance` and includes additional attributes like temperature control.
    - Implement methods for temperature management and optionally providing detailed refrigerator information.

### Bonus Test

- **BonusTest (7 points)**: This additional test checks for advanced functionality and integration between the `Appliance` and `Refrigerator` classes. It's an opportunity to demonstrate a deeper understanding of inheritance and array handling.

### Running Tests

Test your solutions by running the provided tests, located in the `src/test/java/com/example` directory. To execute the tests, use:

```
./gradlew test
```

This will run all the standard tests, as well as the bonus test.

### Submission

Once you have completed the tasks and all tests, including the bonus test, pass successfully, push your code back to your GitHub repository.

This assignment is a fantastic opportunity to solidify your understanding of Java inheritance, class relationships, and array handling. Best of luck, and remember, the bonus test is there to stretch your skills even further!
